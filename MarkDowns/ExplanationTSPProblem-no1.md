# The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): Theory, Algorithms, and Applications

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) asks: given a list of \(n\) cities and the distances (or costs) between each pair, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.  
In graph-theoretic terms, we seek a minimum-cost Hamiltonian cycle in a weighted complete graph. A standard integer linear programming (ILP) formulation introduces binary variables $\(x_{ij}=1\)$ if the tour goes from city \(i\) to \(j\), and 0 otherwise, and minimizes the total cost $\(\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x_{ij}\)$.

To ensure each city is entered and left exactly once, we enforce for each city \(j\):

$$
\sum_{i \neq j} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \sum_{k \neq j} x_{jk} = 1.
$$

These constraints mean every city has exactly one incoming and one outgoing edge.

## Subtour Elimination

Additional subtour-elimination constraints are needed to prevent disconnected cycles; there are exponentially many such constraints (on the order of \(2^n\)).

Altogether, the ILP is:
$$
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x_{ij}, \quad x_{ij} \in \{0,1\},
$$
subject to the “enter/leave once” constraints above and subtour-elimination constraints.

### Complexity

Because of this combinatorial complexity, the TSP is NP-hard (the decision version is NP-complete).  
The naive brute-force approach checks all \((n-1)!\) tours in \(O(n!)\) time, which is only feasible for very small \(n\). Even smarter exact methods (like the Held–Karp dynamic programming) take \(O(n^2 2^n)\) time.

In practice, one often uses branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut methods (solving LP relaxations and adding cuts) to prune the search space. However, in the worst case, the complexity remains exponential, since there are about \((n-1)!\) possible tours.

## Convex Geometry Applications

In the Euclidean TSP (points in the plane with Euclidean distances), geometry provides some useful properties. For example, if all cities lie on the convex hull of the point set, they will appear in the optimal tour in the same cyclic order as on the hull.

One heuristic is to compute the convex hull and use it as a backbone tour, then insert interior points greedily.

More generally, the TSP polytope is the convex hull of all incidence vectors of tours. Optimization over this polytope (finding cutting planes that separate a fractional solution from the hull) was pioneered by Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson.

Solving the LP relaxation of the ILP with cuts is a classic example of convex relaxations: each LP solution is an extreme point of a convex polytope, and if it is not integral, one finds a hyperplane (cut) that separates it.

Despite this, because the subtour-elimination facets grow exponentially, the LP relaxation alone does not make TSP easy.

Convex optimization typically deals with continuous variables and convex feasible sets, guaranteeing global optimality and polynomial-time solvability. The TSP’s feasible region is non-convex and discrete.

Nonetheless, convex optimization ideas are used via relaxations, e.g., linear or semidefinite relaxations. These provide lower bounds (like the Held–Karp bound via Lagrangian relaxation) but do not directly yield integer tours.

## Algorithms for TSP

### Exact Methods

- **Brute-force enumeration**: Try all \((n-1)!/2\) distinct tours (for undirected TSP). Complexity: \(O(n!)\).
- **Dynamic Programming (Held–Karp)**: Uses subsets and bitmask DP. Time and space: \(O(2^n n^2)\).
- **Branch-and-Bound / Branch-and-Cut**: Uses bounds (e.g., LP relaxation) and dynamically adds cuts.
  - Example: Concorde TSP solver.

### Heuristics

- **Nearest Neighbor**: Start at a city and repeatedly travel to the nearest unvisited city.
  - Time: \(O(n^2)\).
  - Typically 25% longer than optimal.

- **Cheapest/Best Insertion**: Insert cities to minimize increase in length. Time: \(O(n^2)\).

- **Local Search and Improvement**:
  - **2-opt**: Replace two edges with two others. Typical gap: ~5% above optimal.
  - **3-opt**: Generalization of 2-opt. Gap: ~3% above optimal.
  - **Lin–Kernighan**: Variable-k opt heuristic; very effective on large instances.

### Approximation Algorithms

- **Christofides' Algorithm**: For metric TSP (triangle inequality), guarantees 1.5 approximation.
  - Steps: MST + matching + shortcutting.

### Metaheuristics

- **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: Evolve population of tours.
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: Accept worse moves with some probability to escape local optima.
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Use pheromone trails to guide tour construction.
- Others: Tabu Search, Particle Swarm Optimization.

## Example Python Implementations

### Nearest Neighbor Heuristic
```python
import math
points = [(0,0), (1,5), (5,2), (6,6), (8,3)]
n = len(points)
def dist(a, b):
    return math.hypot(a[0]-b[0], a[1]-b[1])
def nearest_neighbor(points, start=0):
    n = len(points)
    unvisited = set(range(n))
    tour = [start]
    current = start
    unvisited.remove(current)
    while unvisited:
        next_city = min(unvisited, key=lambda j: dist(points[current], points[j]))
        unvisited.remove(next_city)
        tour.append(next_city)
        current = next_city
    return tour
tour = nearest_neighbor(points)
print("Tour:", tour)
print("Length:", sum(dist(points[tour[i]], points[tour[(i+1)%n]]) for i in range(n)))
```

### Simulated Annealing
```python
import random, math

def tour_length(tour):
    return sum(dist(points[tour[i]], points[tour[(i+1)%n]]) for i in range(n))

current_tour = list(range(n))
random.shuffle(current_tour)
current_len = tour_length(current_tour)
T, alpha, min_T = 100.0, 0.995, 1e-3

while T > min_T:
    i, j = sorted(random.sample(range(n), 2))
    new_tour = current_tour[:]
    new_tour[i:j] = reversed(new_tour[i:j])
    new_len = tour_length(new_tour)
    if new_len < current_len or random.random() < math.exp((current_len - new_len) / T):
        current_tour, current_len = new_tour, new_len
    T *= alpha

print("Simulated Annealing Tour:", current_tour)
print("Length:", current_len)
```
